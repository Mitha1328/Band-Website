# Band-Website
This will be my project on creating a website for a Band called One Direction
One-Direction Website
S10207330
About my Project:

This website is about a band that is on Hiatus (Break) after their 5 years of World-Wide Mega Hit boy band, from the year 2010-2015.
They were brought together from the reality show X-Factor.

I have made this website from scratch where I did some extra exploring into W3 Schools.
Some additional features like Hovering effects and fade in images I learnt from the internet.
Building this website made me understand and explore certain features where I believed to be real hard to code.


Design Process
One Direction is a Boy-Band which has many girl fans.
The design must encase the Boy's edgy side and it must be aesthetically trendy and catchy to the eyes of the young girl fandom.
I took some inspiration from One Direction's Original Website too.


Features:
 1)Using Flex-Box:
    Using flex-box to decorate the website makes it really easy to transform into a Responsive Html Site.
    I used them as much as I can in the code too.

2)Hover-Cycle:
    Hover-cycle or on hover colour change makes the website even more attractive.

3)Video Background:
    This video background in the tab "Tour", is a direct inspiration from the Real One Direction Website. I have always wondered how people code them out, with this website creating process I was able to learn how its done.

4)Fade-In Pictures:
    I have used some javascript to make the picture fade in, in the tab "Band". I was intrigued on how javascript is used in html and css and figured them out with some research.

5)SVG-Icons
    When I searched on how to change the colors of Icons on cursor hover, I was brought to attention that useing SVG inline text is the easiest. I scuvered the internet on some Pre-Done SVG Icon Code where the svg icons are in coded form and I easily changed the on hover option with a "Fill" option.

6)Slide-Show
    Slide-Show is a feature that I implemented into the "Band-Archive" tab. Where I embeded youtube videos of One Direction's Music Videos so that the viewers of the website can get straight experience of the Band's edgy music.



Existing Features
    A normal yet responsive page that is neat and relvant with due containers

Additional features to be implemented in the future:
1) Sticky Header
    I tried to use them when I was codeing this website but in the end the sticky div was not working and it was quite hard to make it responsive too. With provided more time and some experience I will be able to add them into the website.


Features Left to Implement
1) Sticky Header

Another feature idea
1) Shop Tab - a new html page where it showcases merchendise and other products by One Direction where the fans can buy to get into the Jolly crazy mood!

Technologies Used
I have used HTML, CSS, and a light amount of javascript to make a fade in image on scroll.

Contact form:
For the Forms page, I have created a "Book Us" page where any coorperate individuals could send in their queries to Book the Band for major events.
The contact us page does give relevant error messages (checked)

Interesting bugs or problems that I discovered during my testing

1) Sticky Header
    I tried to use them when I was codeing this website but in the end the sticky div was not working and it was quite hard to make it responsive too. With provided more time and some experience I will be able to add them into the website.


Credits
    I would really credit the lecture notes and W3 School where I was able to learn many things from.
